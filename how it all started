The idea to make a web app came to mine mind when for the first time i participated in topcoder development challenge during summer holidays of mine in july.The competitions that are held on topcoder have a story board associated with it.In accordance with which we are supposed to make an application for proposing party.

The first competition in which i participated didn't strictly involved usage of angularjs but during latter stages of competition i found out that amount of work which i had to do could have been reduced to many folds less if i had made use of Angularjs.
This was the first instance which made me realise importance of this MVC framework.Mine interest to learn this MVC increased more when on topcoder i viewed a lot of competitions in which usage of Angular js was must and i was not being able to participate due mine lack of knowledge.

So ,after the summer break when our college re-opened and we were asked to make a project using web technologies.Then without needing to think i decided along with mine other batchmates that we will definetly be developing some app and make use of Angularjs in it for sure.
Here we are bunch of zealots who have tried to realise our thoughts in reality....
